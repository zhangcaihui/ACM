about how to connect local git with remote git:
1.$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "email"
2.$ start ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
3.login into github and add a new SSH key // the key-pass word is in id_rsa.pub
4.$ ssh -T git@github.com // which can test wither connected with remote git
5.$ git clone git@github.com:[which git I want to connect]

read branches: git branch 
/* 
add '-a' can read both local branch and remote branch
if add [branch name], can build or turn to this branch
*/
delete remote branch:	git push origin :[branch name]
delete local branch: git branch -D [branch name]
